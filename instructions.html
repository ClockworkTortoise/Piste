    <h1>Piste - Instructions</h1>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="game.html">Piste</a> is a simple two-player game of board control, with a loose "hand-to-hand combat" theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of the game, one player controls a number of spaces at the top of the board, and the other player controls a number of spaces at the bottom.
      The players will play cards to expand their control and reduce their opponent's control, earning points for any spaces they are able to maintain control of.

    <h2 id="components">Game Components</h2>
    <h4 id="the-board">Board</h4>
    <p>
      Piste is played on a board with hexagonal spaces. At the start of the game, the board looks like this:
    </p>
    <canvas id="board-illus" style="background-color: #d0e0d0"></canvas>
    <p>
      The region in the middle is initially not controlled by either player.
      The two similarly-colored regions at the top are controlled by one player (who will be referred to as the "top player"),
      and the two regions at the bottom are controlled by the other player (referred to as the "bottom player").
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that the uppermost and lowermost spaces in each column are colored differently is that those are each player's "core" spaces, which they can never lose control of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most board spaces containing a number indicating how many points that space is worth, with an arrow pointing toward the player who can score for controlling that space.
      Spaces without a number aren't worth any points to either player.
    </p>
    <h4 id="hands-and-labels">Player-Specific Components</h4>
    <p>
      Each player has a hand of cards, which will be shown to the right of the board.
      To the right of the players' hands, you'll see each player's score, along with an indication of whose turn it is.
      This will look something like this:
    </p>
    <canvas id="hand-and-label-illus" style="background-color: #d0e0d0"></canvas>

    <h2 id="turn-order">Turn Order</h2>
    <p>
      At the start of the game, a random player is chosen to take the first turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each turn, the following things happen in this order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The active player (i.e. the player whose turn it is) scores for any spaces they still control on their opponent's side of the board.</li>
      <li>The active player chooses a card to play, and where to play it on the board.</li>
      <li>The active player gains control of whichever spaces their card gives them control of,
        except that if they would gain control of any of their opponent's core spaces this way, instead they immediately score points for those spaces.</li>
      <li>Each player loses control of any spaces that aren't connected to their core spaces through spaces they control.</li>
      <li>The active player discards the card they played, as well as the leftmost card that they didn't play.
        Whatever remains in their hand shifts to the left, and they get new cards to fill their hand back up to the hand size.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each of these is described in more detail in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2 id="scoring">Step 1: Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      At the start of your turn, for each space you control that's closer to your opponent's side of the board than to yours,
      you'll earn the number of points shown in that space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this happens before you play your card for the turn,
      so you won't score for any spaces that your opponent managed to take away from you during their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "core" spaces at the top and bottom of the board work a little differently;
      you can never control your opponent's core spaces, but you score immediately if you hit them.
      See the section on <a href="#capture">capturing spaces</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make it slightly easier to see which spaces score for which player (especially near the center of the board),
      each space that's worth points has an arrow pointing toward the player who can score points by controlling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One row of spaces in the middle of the board is equally close to both sides and is therefore not worth points to either player,
      so the spaces in that row don't have numbers in them.
    </p>

    <h2 id="playing-cards">Step 2: Choosing Where to Play a Card</h2>
    <p>
      To play a card, you'll first have to select it by clicking on it.
      You can change which card is selected by clicking on a different one,
      or you can deselect your current card by clicking on it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After selecting a card, you'll have to choose a legal place to play it on the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that each card has an illustration containing two types of spaces:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The spaces in the illustration that are solidly filled with your color indicate <em>requirements</em>.
        In order to play a card, you must line up its pattern on the board in such a way that all the required spaces line up with spaces you control.
      </li>
      <li>
        The spaces that are mostly the neutral color but with a plus symbol in your color indicate which spaces the card lets you <em>capture</em>.
        Once you choose a legal place to play the card, you'll either gain control of these spaces or earn points for them.
        See the section on <a href="#capture">capturing spaces</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, consider this card (the illustration on the left is for the top player, and the one on the right is for the bottom player):
    </p>
    <canvas id="card-illus" style="background-color: #d0e0d0"></canvas>
    <p>
      In order to play this card, you must control two vertically-adjacent spaces.
      If you do, the card lets you capture the next five spaces toward your opponent in the same column.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you have a card selected, moving your mouse around the board will let you see where it can be played and what the effects will be.
      Below is a demonstration that allows you to try this out.
      The demo is somewhat randomized; click the button below it to try out different cards for different players.
    </p>
    <canvas id="targeting-demo" width="1500" height="800" style="background-color: #d0e0d0" onmousemove="handleMouseMove(event)"></canvas>
    <p><button onclick="randomizeTargetingDemo()">Randomize</button></p>
    <p>
      Things to note:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a required space lines up with a space you control, it's marked with a checkmark.</li>
      <li>If a required space lines up with a space that's neutral or controlled by your opponent, it's marked with an X in your color.</li>
      <li>If a required space isn't on the board, an X will be placed in one of the empty spaces at the corners of the board.</li>
      <li>Spaces you would capture by playing the card there are marked with a circle.
        If the circles use dashed lines, that means you can't play the card there because one or more required spaces are missing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="capture">Step 3: Capturing Spaces</h2>
    <p>
      Once you've chosen where to play your card, click the mouse in order to capture the circled spaces.
      (Note that the demo above is just meant to illustrate targeting and won't do anything if you click on it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capturing" means one of two things depending on what kind of space you're capturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you capture a neutral space, or a non-core space controlled by your opponent, the space switches to your control.
      On your future turns, you'll score points for the space if you still control it at the start of your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't gain control of your opponent's core spaces, but instead, if you capture one of them, you'll <em>immediately</em> earn points for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, capturing core spaces is better for getting points immediately but typically worse for getting points over multiple turns,
      especially considering that when you're playing that close to your opponent's side of the board,
      they will likely be able to recapture many of the other spaces you took control of at the same time that you hit their core.
    </p>

    <h2 id="disconnect">Step 4: Lose Control of Disconnected Spaces</h2>
    <p>
      You can only retain control of spaces that form a contiguous group with your core spaces.
      Any spaces that aren't part of a contiguous group with their controller's core will be set to neutral in this step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually this happens because the active player captured some of the spaces that were previously connecting others of their opponent's spaces to their core.
      However, it can also happen to the active player, if you play a card whose effect captures some spaces that aren't connected to the required spaces,
      or if the captured spaces have a hook-like shape and some of the spaces in the middle of the hook land in your opponent's core.
      (At the time of this writing, only Lunge falls into the first category, and no cards fall into the second.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="reset-hand">Step 5: Discard and Draw</h2>
    <p>
      The card you played will be discarded after you play it.
      In order to keep players' hands from getting clogged with weak cards, the leftmost card you didn't play will also be discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      After those two cards are discarded, whatever remains will be shifted to the left, and new cards will be added to bring your hand back up to the hand size.
      At the time of this writing, the game simply generates new cards every time; you might end up with multiple copies of the same card,
      and cards you've seen recently are just as likely to be generated as cards that haven't appeared all game.
    </p>

    <h2 id="winning">Winning the Game</h2>
    <p id="point-target">
      As soon as either player reaches a certain target number of points, the game ends and that player wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happens whether the points are earned by capturing core spaces or by controlling spaces at the start of the turn.
      If you hit the target score by capturing one or more of your opponent's core spaces,
      you win even if your opponent would have earned enough points to beat your score at the start of their turn.
    </p>
